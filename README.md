# SOC Analyst Journey - Day 2: Learning the ELK Stack & Future with Ruby

## Overview
This document captures the progress made on **Day 2** of my SOC Analyst journey, focusing on the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and future learning goals involving **Ruby** for SOC-related tasks.

## ELK Stack Overview
- **Elasticsearch:** The core search engine for storing and retrieving log data efficiently.
- **Logstash:** A log management tool that processes and filters data before indexing it in Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana:** A visual dashboard tool that allows you to visualize Elasticsearch data and monitor for security anomalies.

## Key Learnings
- ELK stack provides real-time insights for SOC teams to detect potential security threats.
- Understanding how to aggregate and monitor logs helps in uncovering patterns and anomalies across a network.

## Next Steps: Ruby & Elasticsearch Integration
As part of the next phase of learning, I plan to use **Ruby** to:
- Automate Elasticsearch queries and tasks with scripts.
- Interact with Elasticsearchâ€™s API to retrieve or index documents.
- Build custom tools to streamline SOC analysis processes using Ruby and Elasticsearch.

Stay tuned for updates on how **Ruby** and **ELK** integration can enhance SOC workflows!
